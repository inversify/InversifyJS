# Why InversifyJS?

There are many good reasons to use InversifyJS but we would like to highlight three of them:

### 1. Real decoupling:

Some "old" JavaScript IoC container like the angular 1.x `$injector` have some problems:

[Source](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html)

InversifyJS solves these problems:

- There is support for transient and singleton scope.
- There are no namespace collisions thanks to tagged, named and contextual bindings.
- It is a stand alone library.



InversifyJS offers you real decoupling. Consider the following class:

```
import TYPES from "./constants/types";

@injectable()
class Ninja implements INinja {

    private _katana: IKatana;
    private _shuriken: IShuriken;

    public constructor(
        @inject(TYPES.IKatana) katana: IKatana,
        @inject(TYPES.IShuriken) shuriken: IShuriken
    ) {
        this._katana = katana;
        this._shuriken = shuriken;
    }

    public fight() { return this._katana.hit(); };
    public sneak() { return this._shuriken.throw(); };

}
```
```
let TYPES = {
  INinja: Symbol("INinja"),
  IKatana: Symbol("IKatana"),
  IShuriken: Symbol("IShuriken")
};

export default TYPES;
```

The `Ninja` class will never point to the `Katana` or `Shuriken` classes. However, 
it will point to the interfaces (at design-time) or Symbols (at run-time) which is 
admissible because these are abstractions and 
[**depending upon abstractions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) 
is what DI is all about.

The InversifyJS kernel is the only element in the application aware of the life-cycle and dependencies. 
We recommend to do this in a file named `inversify.config.ts` and store the file in the root folder 
that contains the application source code:

    import TYPES from "./constants/types";

    import Katana from "./entitites/katana";
    import Shuriken from "./entitites/shuriken";
    import Ninja from "./entitites/ninja";

    kernel.bind<IKatana>(TYPES.IKATANA).to(Katana);
    kernel.bind<IShuriken>(TYPES.ISHURIKEN).to(Shuriken);
    kernel.bind<INinja>(TYPES.ININJA).to(Ninja);

This means that all the coupling in your application takes place in one unique place: the `inversify.config.ts` file. 
This is really important and we are going to prove it with an example. 
Let's imagine that we are changing the difficulty in a game. 
We just need to go to the `inversify.config.ts` and change the Katana binding:

    import Katana from "./entitites/SharpKatana";

    if(difficulty === "hard") {
        kernel.bind<IKatana>(TYPES.IKATANA).to(SharpKatana);
    } else {
        kernel.bind<IKatana>(TYPES.IKATANA).to(Katana);
    }

You don't need to change the Ninja file!

The price to pay is the usage of Symbols or string literals but this price can be mitigated if you declare all your 
string literals in a file which contains constants 
([like actions in Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/examples/todomvc/constants/ActionTypes.js)). 
The good news is that in the future the symbols or string literals 
[could end up being generated by the TS compiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2577), but 
that is in the hands of the TC39 committee for the moment.

### 2. All the features that you may need
As far as I know it is the only IoC container for JavaScript that features complex dependency 
resolution (e.g. contextual bindings), multiple scopes (transient, singleton) and many other features. 
On top of that there is room for growth with features like interception or web worker scope. 
We also have plans for the development of dev-tools like browser extensions and middleware (logging, caching...). 

### 3. Type safety
The library has been developed using TypeScript so type safety comes out of the box if you work 
with TypeScript but it is nice to mention that if you try to inject a Katana into a class that 
expects an implementation of IShuriken you will get a compilation error.
